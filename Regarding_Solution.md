I try to this problem of semantic segmentation by using the U-net 
In the solution 1 I divided the file into the four parts the first is about the image access in order into access from the local system i have to change the name of bugsy dataset
name because the name contains many spaces of the image folder and image have its unique name so its difficult to access it and throws the error and also try it accessing the excel
sheet that are provided but with numpy manipulation technique its still not able to do that

The Solution 1 throws error when in the train file when model are being trained the error is type error and also it may be related to epoch parameter of model i try many different 
parameter and changing the datatype of pixel data of image but i Can't sure which data throws an error

Solution 2 also doing the same thing but all code written in single file also i run the file in local system i takes very long time resizing and training the model also overheating
issues in my system that why I can't able to confirm the solution because of it The solution may give black background and white image of object
